        <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
        <p>This is my very first webpage and to be quiet honest it has been really fun to make so far.
            On this webage there are 3 buttons that will direct you to a different webpage. There is Home button that will direct you back to the home screen.
            Then there is about me button that will direct you to a webpage the gives more in depth information about myself that i believe you will find pretty interesting.
            Then lastly there is the javascript button that while have more information in the future.</p>
