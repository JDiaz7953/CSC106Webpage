            I Believe I achieve more in a more hands on field and also beleieve the field is great for letting ones creativity loose.

            <p>When I was younger I enjoyed playing football and now I make sure im always up to date with anything going on in the football world.

            As of right now I remain focused on my studies and once I finsish college I am hoping to be working as a sofware engineer for a great company
                in the future.</p>
